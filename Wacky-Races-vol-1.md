And aaaawaaaay they go! - This is the first thing that comes to my mind when thinking about Wacky Races. This and the agony of not being able to decide who to root for. Over the years I grew to like every single character - even Penelope. Then it was over. Cartoon Network didn't air it anymore. I was really sad when I turned on the TV and it wasn't on. I checked the listings frantically, but it was never to be found. I endured years...

Then the internet became big. So big, even our family could afford it. Oh the time I spent hunting video bits and downloads of old cartoons... Back then Youtube wasn't really a thing so it wasn't straightforward. Still, I managed to watch the guys quite a lot. Then life came and I had other things to do than watching cartoons so I didn't look for them.

Right until now. Well to be honest I wasn't looking for them this time either, but they've found me. They became more mature, more serious and a lot weirder. But they're here and they fill a whole book of racing adventures. See, Wacky Raceland is part of the thing DC and Hannah-Barbera are doing: they took 4 popular concepts, spiced them up a bit and created new comic books. I already wrote about Future Quest and here we are: Wacky Raceland.

The story takes place after an apocalypse of all sorts: some parts of the world were attacked by weird creatures, some sank deep under water and only a few people survived - and they're mostly mutants. We don't really get any explanation why or how it happened, we only know that it did. Well that, and the fact that we're the witnesses of some weird - or even... wacky - race between mutants, neanderthals, sociopaths and neonazis - that bit really broke my heart tbh.

I'd say the story is good, although it's a bit too fast-paced, but yeah, the 6-issue limit didn't help. I really liked the flashbacks and origin stories of the "new" and changed characters, but the jumping around in timelines can be confusing at times - especially towards the end. I might not pop anyone's balloon if I say this book is definitely not for children. If you think it is based on the fact it adapted a cartoon, read it, think again. The whole plot, the Announcer's and the racers' actions and the resolution of the book are all very grim, but hey: it's the apocalypse, right?

A few words about the characters: I won't tell specifics because it's one of the most exciting thing about this book but the characters are very well-made and I'm pretty sure the creators gave a lot of thought to how to evolve them from their rather one-dimensional past self. There's a few things which are not as good in my opinion - but that's only my personal preference I guess.

The drawing looks amazing, it's nothing like Future Quest and doesn't even try to resemble the original cartoon. It gives the whole book a fresh and modern vibe while keeps the characters and cars recognizable, which is an amazing feat in itself.

All summed up, I very much recommend picking this up whether you were a fan of the original cartoon or just like comic books, you won't be disappointed.

AND AAAAWAAAAY THEY GO!
