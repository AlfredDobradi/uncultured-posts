Alright so let's start with a confession: even though I'm very interested in KSP, I was never inclined to actually learn at least the minimum required mechanics to be able to do anything.

Recently a good friend of mine - [DreadHeadEd](twitch.tv/dreadheaded) if you're interested - started playing it again on stream to a point I felt triggered by my inability so far to sit through the training and grind that bitch until I make orbit. Not anymore though! I'm proud to announce that yesterday at 11:39 PM GMT, Jeb Kerman successfully orbited the Mun. Well actually the ship did with Jeb on it.

The thing is, it took me almost 2 hours to make it. But I did. And man did it feel great. There's not many games that's as satisfying to play as this. The joy you feel when you finally nail a maneuver you'd messed up several times, it's just priceless really.

So yeah, I've played roughly 5 hours total yesterday and I'm still only scratching the surface but it was good fun - while also making me realize how short my attention span is. I've built a few rockets too, had a fair share of scientific breakthroughs in career mode, so all in all, I had a marvelous time and I recommend you getting it if you're into the whole space thing!
