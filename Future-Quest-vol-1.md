Welly well! This is my first comic book post on a blog I actually wanted to dedicated only to comics - okay, okay it's only the third post so not it's THAT big, but still.

Let's get to it, shall we? I've always loved Hannah-Barbera cartoons. I grew up watching Space Ghost, Birdman, Johnny Quest, Whacky Races - which I'll write about in a future post - so yeah, I'm quite fond of these memories. Why did I tell that? Because Future Quest has - almost - all of the characters from these amazing pieces of entertainment and I can safely say: the magic's still there.

Until like a week ago I haven't heard about this book, I found it by accident actually, but as soon as I saw the preview I knew I need it. I was prepared for the worst: a bad reboot trying to ride the nostalgia-train, but boy I was wrong. Indeed it does induce a fair amount of nostalgia, but it's not all that. It's a great book in its own! Of course it helps if you know the characters better but it does a good job at least giving a glimpse of their origins so you're not completely in the dark about who's who.

The story itself is a multiverse-uniting thing, but it doesn't feel stale, at least for me it didn't. I liked the idea of the creature whose fault the whole shenanigans is and the reason all these characters get thrown into Johnny and co.'s world.

And the drawing... it's just like it was a crisp renovated version of the classic toons I used to spend my Saturday and Sunday mornings watching. It was just the same, rooting for Johnny and Space Ghost, now in one panel, one story. It was just amazing.
