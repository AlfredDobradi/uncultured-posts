I still like to think I'm a DC guy, but I have to admit, when it comes to the big screen, Marvel is just better. Even though they made some laughable attempts, they greenlit some amazing films and it just seem like they care more. While their movies are not always perfect, they're entertaining - looking at you Ant Man.


The movie itself is just beautiful. The photography is amazing and surprisingly enough, the special effects doesn't make you think they're there just to make 3D worth its money. The way they bend the material plane suits the story perfectly, it's never just a gimmick. One of my favorite scenes in the movie was when the guy "fell out" the house into the desert. That was brilliantly mind boggling. The magic shields and weapons look arcane as balls, not just some cheap bazaar trick. And the Dark Dimension... boy that was trippy.


The story itself is basically adopted from the origin story as-is and - not surprisingly - really good. It doesn't stray off - drastically - the beaten path, although there are some differences between the origin story and the movie. First of all: the training took years and it was brutal. Also Strange's personality got a nice facelift: in the books he's a lot more arrogant and just not funny at all. Remember, he's a guy who refuses to work for someone even if it means he goes broke, he just doesn't care about people or what people think about him.
Oh also, Mordo is Strange's nemesis.


As for Doctor Strange: Benedict Cumberbatch is not your go-to superhero type guy. I'll be honest, I expected him to turn up as a villain before first heard about him being selected as Strange. That though, makes sense. Exactly because he's not your classic superhero build, he's perfect for the role - not to mention his amazing talent in acting. He's a great Strange, through the whole movie: he's just credible in all situations.


In summary, I think Doctor Strange is one of the best comic book adaptations to date and I'm willing to go to fisticuffs with anyone who says otherwise. I'd definitely recommend watching the movie - or better: read the books ;)
