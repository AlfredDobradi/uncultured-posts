I'm fed up with traditional blogging. I live a life that's not worth documenting really. I'd rather keep most of my thoughts for myself too, so seems like - and believe me, I tried - blogging is not for me. I like writing though. I like writing about stuff. Like, culture stuff. Movies, books, games, y'know. So I was thinking: what if I'd blog about those? Not the most original idea ever in the age of webzines and all, but still, something I might be able to sink a bit of time into and enjoy, right?

So here we are, Uncultured, the newest blog of Barvey Hirdman. Hope you'll enjoy!
